Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am pursuing a PhD at the [IMAGE section](https://di.ku.dk/english/research/image/) of the [Department of Computer Science](https://di.ku.dk/english/), [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/), co-supervised by [Prof Sune Darkner](https://di.ku.dk/english/staff/vip/researchers_image/?pure=en/persons/383640) and [Prof Michael Bachmann Nielsen](https://research.regionh.dk/rigshospitalet/da/persons/michael-bachmann-nielsen(87d575e5-755e-4182-b94d-75776981fc21).html).

My PhD research aims to develop trustworthy AI for medical imaging, where trustworthiness focuses on Explainable AI (XAI) and also extends to human-in-the-loop learning and uncertainty quantification. In collaboration with my fantastic colleagues, I also dabble in image registration, segmentation and classification.

Previously, I attained  my MSc in Computational Science at the [Department of Information Technology](https://www.it.uu.se/), [Uppsala University](https://uu.se/en/). There I had the pleasure of working in the [MIDA group](https://www.it.uu.se/research/visual_information_and_interaction/research/mida), under the supervision of [Prof NataÅ¡a Sladoje](https://www.cb.uu.se/~natasa/) and [Prof Joakim Lindblad](https://www.cb.uu.se/~joakim/).
